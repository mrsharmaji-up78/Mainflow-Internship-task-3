Project Overview:-
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies for different segments effectively.

Objective:-
->Load and clean the dataset.
->Perform exploratory data analysis.
->Determine the optimal number of clusters.
->Apply clustering techniques to segment customers.
->Visualize findings using Python libraries.

Project Workflow:-

->Data Loading
Load dataset using Pandas.
Display first few rows using .head().

->Data Exploration
Check for missing values.
Display column data types.
Analyze dataset dimensions.

3-> Data Cleaning
Handle missing values.
Remove duplicate entries.

-> Data Analysis Questions
What is the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method?
How are customers segmented based on annual income and spending score?
Which cluster represents high-spending customers?
What marketing strategies can be applied to different customer segments?

->Data Visualization
Elbow Method plot for optimal clusters.
2D Scatter plot for customer segmentation.
